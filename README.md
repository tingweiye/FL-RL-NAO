# FL-RL-NAO

This is the webot environment for our Fedros federated and reinforcement learning framework. The main control code is under controllers/my_controller.

## Environment

The project utilizes a standard webot paradigm for its framework. In addition to the FL/RL controller, we have included a foundational environment where three robots train in independent areas. See the following figure:

Place the folder under webot's directory and run the world(environment file under /worlds).
